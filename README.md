Compound Interest Calculator

Author: Sammy Santos

About the Project

My goal was to create a working web app that accurately calculated compound interest. This project was an excersize in html, css, and javascript. 

index.html - html file that generates and formats the website.

styles.css - css file that assigns various attributes to html elements.

script.js - javascript file that does the computing part of the calculator.

The font is a google font called matemasie.

There are a variety of input elements for inputting the numbers for the calculation, which allowed me to explore dropdowns, sliders, and buttons.

The images rotate when hovered over using transitions.

The app is deployed at: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/compound-interest-calculator-hw1-pt84f3
